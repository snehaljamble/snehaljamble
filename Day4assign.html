Q5)You are managing a sales department for your company,you want to reward your employees based on the sales made by them during the year
 The criteria is as follows
 1)Sales from 0-5000:2%
 2)Sales from 5001-10000:5%
 3)Sales from 10001-20000:7%
 3)Above 20000:10%

Then log the total commission earned by them

/*Q6)
write a loop  which prompts for a number greater than 100.if the visitor enters another number ask them to input again
The lop must ask for a number  greater than 100 or cancels the input/an empty  line.

Rewrite the function using ? or ||.



let num=prompt("ENter a number")

while(num)
{
	if(num>100)
	{	console.log("You entered number:"+num+"greate than 100")

function check(num)
{

}

/*An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
except 1 and itself.
In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.
For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value
	

var n = window.prompt("Enter Number:");
		nextPrime:
		for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) 
		{ 
			for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) 
			{ 
    			if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime; 
			}

			alert( i );
